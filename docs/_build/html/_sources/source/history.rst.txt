History of the project
======================

The fmcw project started a few years ago as Henrik Forsten attempted to build a radar with readily accessible components. His blog is the best source of technical information on the hardware.

The fmcw package aims at generalizing the python code he open sourced on GitHub and provide the user with a lot more features. By lowering the threshold required to get into building a radar, the hope is to grow a community of passionate radar makers.
